1.  Introduction

   Scheduling-related tasks are usually considered for efficient and
   deterministic network management.  Such scheduling may be
   characterized as simple recurrent tasks such as planned activation/
   deactivation of some network accesses, or can be more complex such as
   scheduling placement of requests and planned invocation of resources
   to satisfy service demands or adhere to local networks policies.
   Many common building blocks are required for all these cases for
   adequate management of schedules and related scheduled actions.

   This document describes the applicability of various network
   management tools and data models may be used for scheduling, to meet
   the requirements of a set of representative use cases described in
   [I-D.ietf-tvr-use-cases].  By leveraging a reference framework
   presented in this document, it shows how IETF data models in
   [I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang] can fit into this framework and
   streamline the management and orchestration of network resources
   based on precise date and time parameters.

   The document also provides guidelines for implementing scheduling
   capabilities across diverse network architectures, ensuring that
   resources are allocated and utilized in a timely and effective
   manner.

   In addition, the document outlines several challenges that must be
   considered when deploying control mechanisms for scheduling network
   resources, including:

   *  Discover where and what scheduling state is held.

   *  Specify to apply schedule policies and detect and resolve
      conflicts.

   *  Ensure synchronization of scheduled resources across distributed
      systems.

   *  Establish a scalable and resilient scheduling system.

   *  Ensure that a scheduling system can scale to accommodate complex
      networks with numerous resources and scheduling requests.

   *  Ensure that the a scheduling system remains operational and can
      recover from failures or disruptions, providing redundancy,
      failover mechanisms, and robust error handling.

   *  Secure scheduled resources.

   *  Identify what mechanisms and policies could be applied to protect
      scheduling data and operations from unauthorized access and
      ensuring that only authorized entities can create, modify, or
      retrieve schedules.

      Editors Note: pointers to sections where each of these items is
      described will be provided in future version.

   Key use cases highlight how the proposed framework can be used for
   scheduling scenarios.  The applicable IETF YANG modules are
   described, as well as other dependencies that are needed.

      Editors Note: In future versions of this document, an appendix
      will also provide JSON examples.

       Figure 1: An Architecture for the Scheduled Network Scenarios

3.1.  Functional Components

3.1.1.  Scheduled Service Requester

   The entity requesting a resource schedule change can vary widely.
   For example, a network administrator may seek to restrict or limit
   access to specific network resources based on day or time to optimize
   performance and enhance security.

   Additionally, higher-layer Operations Support System (OSS) components
   may impose restrictions on network resources in response to changing
   network conditions, ensuring service continuity and compliance with
   operational policies.  Automated systems and AI-driven components can
   also request dynamic adjustments based on real-time data,
   facilitating predictive maintenance and optimizing resource usage to
   maintain peak network efficiency.

3.1.2.  Scheduled Service Responder

   This component is responsibile handling scheduling orders.  That is,
   this entity manages and coordinates all network scheduling
   activities.  The extact internal structure of this entity is
   deployment-specific; however this document describes an example
   internla decomposition of this entity:

   *  Resource Manager:  Manages the network resources that are subject
         to scheduling.

   *  Schedule Manager:  Handles creation, modification, deletion, and
         querying of schedules.

   *  Conflict Resolver:  Detects and resolves scheduling conflicts
         based on predefined policies and priorities.

   *  Policy Engine:  Enforces scheduling policies and rules, ensuring
         compliance with organizational requirements.

   Examples of a schedule service responder may be a network controller,
   network management system or the network device itself.

3.2.  Functional Interfaces

   To support the scheduling of network resources effectively, several
   functional interfaces are required.  These interfaces interconnect
   different components of the network scheduling system, ensuring
   seamless integration and operation, these include:

   *  Schedule Service Requester and Responder API:  Schedule resource
         order creation, order modification, and deletion requests and
         responses.  Querying of current and upcoming schedules,
         conflict and alert notifications.

   *  Schedule Service Responder and Network API:  Manages interactions
         with the network resources, inventory systems, planning
         systems, etc.  Capable of querying available resources,
         allocating and deallocating resources based on current schedule
         plan, and monitoring resource utilization.

3.3.  Data Sources

   When scheduling network resources, a variety of data sources are
   required to accurately assess the network state and make informed
   scheduling decisions.  Here are some example data sources that will
   be required:

   *  Network Topology Information:  Connection details about the
         physical and logical layout of the network, including nodes,
         ports/links, and interconnections.

   *  Network Resource Inventory:  A comprehensive list of deployed
         network resources that are not currently in service, but may be
         available if enabled.

   *  Current Network Utilization:  Real-time data on the current usage
         of network resources, including bandwidth consumption, CPU
         load, memory usage, and power consumption.

   *  Historic Network Utilization:  Past data on the current usage of
         network resources, including bandwidth consumption, CPU load,
         memory usage, and power consumption.

   *  Scheduled Maintenance and Planned Outages:  Information on planned
         maintenance activities, scheduled downtimes, and service
         windows.

   It is critical to leverage these diverse data sources, so network
   administrators and automated systems can make well-informed
   scheduling decisions that optimize resource utilization, maintain
   network performance, and ensure service reliability.

3.4.  State Management

   The scheduling state is maintained in the schedule manager, which is
   responsible for the creation, deletion, modification, and query of
   scheduling information.

   Groupings "schedule-status" and "schedule-status-with-name" in the
   "ietf-schedule" YANG module [I-D.ietf-netmod-schedule-yang] define
   common parameters for scheduling management, including status
   exposure.

3.5.  Policy and Enforcement

   Policies are a set of rules to administer, manage, and control access
   to network resources.  For example, the following shows an example of
   a scheduled ACL policy:

   drop TCP traffic source-port 16384 time 2025-12-01T08:00:00Z
   /2025-12-15T18:00:00Z

   A set of scheduling policies and rules are maintained by the policy
   engine, which is responsible for the policy enforcement.  Policies
   are triggered to execute at a certain time based on the scheduling
   parameters.  Each policy might be executed multiple times, depending
   on the its scheduling type (one-shot vs. recurrence).

3.6.  Synchronization

   It is critical to ensure all network schedule entities, including
   controllers and management systems are synchronized to a common time
   reference.  System instability and unpredictability might be caused
   if there is any time inconsistencies between entities that request/
   respond to policies or events based on time-varying parameters.
   Several methods are available to achieve this.

4.  TVR Use Cases with Code Example

4.1.  Energy Efficient

   Tidal network is a typical scenario of Energy Efficient case.  The
   tidal network means the volume of traffic in the network changes
   periodically like the ocean tide.  This changes are mainly affected
   by human activities.  Therefore, this tidal effect is obvious in
   human-populated areas, such as campuses and airport.

   In the context of a tidal network, If the network maintains all the
   devices up to guarantee the maximum throughput all the time, a lot of
   power will be wasted.  The energy-saving methods may include the
   deactivation of some or all components of network nodes.  These
   activities have the potential to alter network topology and impact
   data routing in a variety of ways.  Interfaces on network nodes can
   be selectively disabled or enabled based on traffic patterns, thereby
   reducing the energy consumption of nodes during periods of low
   network traffic.

4.1.1.  Applicable Models

   The following provides a list of applicable YANG modules that can be
   used to exchange data between schedule service requester and
   responder specified in Section 3:

   *  The "ietf-tvr-node" YANG module in [I-D.ietf-tvr-schedule-yang]
      which is a device model, is designed to manage a single node with
      scheduled attributes (e.g., powered on/off).

   *  [I-D.ietf-netmod-schedule-yang] defines "ietf-schedule" YANG
      module for scheduling that works as common building blocks for
      YANG modules described in this section.  The module doesn't define
      any protocol-accessible nodes but a set of reusable groupings
      applicable to be used in any scheduling contexts.

4.1.2.  Code Examples

   The following indicates the example of a scheduling node that is
   powered on from 12 AM, December 1, 2025 to 12 AM, December 1, 2026 in
   UTC and its interface named interface1 is scheduled to enable at 7:00
   AM and disabled at 1:00 AM, every day, from December 1, 2025 to
   December 1, 2026 in UTC.  The JSON encoding is used only for
   illustration purposes.

                        }
                     ]
                  }
               }
            ]
         }
      ]
   }

5.  Other Dependencies

   This sections presents some outstanding dependencies that need to be
   considered when deploying the scheduling mechanism.  This may not be
   exhaustive.

5.1.  Access Control

   Access control ensures only authorized control entities can have
   access to schedule information, including querying, creation,
   modification, and deletion of schedules.  Unauthorized access may
   lead to unintended consequences.

   The Network Access Control Model (NACM) [RFC8341] provides standard
   mechanisms to restrict access for particular uses to a preconfigured
   subset of all available NETCONF or RESTCONF protocol operations and
   content.

5.2.  Atomic Operations

   Atomic operations are guaranteed to be either executed completely or
   not executed at all.  Deployments based on scheduling must ensure
   schedule changes based on recurrence rules are applied as atomic
   transactions.  Either all changes are successfully applied, or none
   at all.  For example, a network policy may be scheduled to be active
   every Tuesday in January of 2025.  If the schedule is changed to
   every Wednesday in January 2025, the recurrence set is changed from
   January 7, 14, 21, 28 to January 1, 8, 15, 22, 29.  If some
   occurrences can not be applied successfully (e.g., January 1 cannot
   be scheduled because of conflict), the others in the recurrence set
   will not be applied as well.

   In addition, the scheduling management of network events, policies,
   services, and resources may involve operations that are performed at
   particular future time(s).  Multiple operations might be involved for
   each instance in the recurrence set, either all operations are
   successfully performed, or none at all.

5.3.  Rollback Mechanism

   Rollback mechanism is useful to ensure that in case of an error, the
   system can revert back to its previous state.  Deployments are
   required to save the checkpoints (manually or automatically) of
   network scheduling activities that can be used for rollback when
   necessary, to maintain network stability.

5.4.  Inter-dependency

   Enfrocement of some secheduled actions may depend on other schedules
   actions.  Means to identify such dependency are needed.

6.  Manageability Considerations

6.1.  Multiple Schedule Service Requesters

   This document does not make any assumption about the number of
   schedule service requester entities that interact with schedule
   service responder.  This means that multiple schedule service
   requesters may send requests to the responder to schedule the same
   network resources, which may lead to conflicts.  If scheduling
   conflicts occur, some predefined policies or priorities may be useful
   to reflect how schedules from different sources should be
   prioritized.

7.  Security Considerations

   Time synchronization may potentially lead to security threats, e.g.,
   attackers may modify the system time and it thus causes time
   inconsistencies and affects the normal functionalities for managing
   and coordinating network scheduling activities.  In addition, care
   must be taken when defining recurrences occurring very often and
   frequent that can be an additional source of attacks by keeping the
   system permanently busy with the management of scheduling.

8.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
